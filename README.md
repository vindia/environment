# Environment
My all purpose development environment. In Vagrant. 

For some projects I use a dedicated Vagrant environment to do development in, but this is my all purpose environment for quick hacks, small projects, etc.

# Inside the box
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS Trusty Thar
* vim
* git
* nginx
* MySQL
* php5-fpm
* Ruby
* Rails
* Mailcatcher
